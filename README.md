    CREATE TABLE contract_projects (
        
        contract_project_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        
        name VARCHAR(255)

        name VARCHAR(255)
    );

    -- Create the educations table
    
    CREATE TABLE educations (
        
        education_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        
        level VARCHAR(255)
    );

    -- Create the clearances table
    
    CREATE TABLE clearances (

        level VARCHAR(255),
        
        status VARCHAR(255)
    );

    -- Create the employees table
    
    CREATE TABLE employees (
            
        name VARCHAR(255),
        
        contract_project_id INT,
        
        work_location_id INT,

        FOREIGN KEY (contract_project_id) REFERENCES contract_projects (contract_project_id),
        
        FOREIGN KEY (work_location_id) REFERENCES work_locations (work_location_id),
